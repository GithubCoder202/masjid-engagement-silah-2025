# masjid-engagement-silah-2025
Silah is an AI-powered platform designed to help new Muslims build a strong support system after converting to Islam by helping them find guidance, belonging, and meaningful relationships within their local Muslim communities. Inspired by Islamic values such as ukhuwwah (brotherhood and sisterhood), compassion, and community, Silah addresses a major challenge many new Muslims face: although accepting Islam is a deeply meaningful journey, many converts struggle to find mentors, supportive friends, beginner-friendly resources, and a welcoming community. The platform acts as an AI-powered community companion that creates personalized recommendations based on each user's interests, goals, location, and experience level, helping them discover Islamic classes, mosque events, volunteer opportunities, and social gatherings. One of Silah’s key features is AI-powered mentor matching, which connects new Muslims with experienced community members who can provide guidance, answer questions, and offer support. Instead of overwhelming users with information, Silah creates a personalized journey that helps users take meaningful steps, such as learning prayer, attending events, meeting mentors, and becoming involved in their community. Silah also helps mosques better understand the needs of new Muslims through anonymous community insights, allowing organizations to create better programs and support systems. Unlike social media platforms, Silah does not focus on followers or online interaction; it focuses on real-world relationships and helping people feel welcomed, supported, and connected. By combining AI with Islamic values of compassion, service, and community, Silah helps solve a major challenge for new Muslims: finding not just information about Islam, but a place where they truly belong.
